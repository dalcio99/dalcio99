- 👋 Hi, I’m @dalcio99
- 👀 I’m currently studying pure math at university.
- 🌱 In the past I mainly focused on mathematical physics (quantum field theory and general relativity), but now I'm getting into Cryptography:
I like how lots of theoretical and different mathematical results can be applied there, even in a fun way!
