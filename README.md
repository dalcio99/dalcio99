- Welcome to my GitHub, I am Nicola!
- I am currently attending the second year of a Masterâ€™s program in Mathematics.
- In addition, I am a student at the [School for Advanced Studies of the University of Udine](https://superiore.uniud.it/it) a merit-based higher institution that organizes courses for excellent students.
- At the moment, I am interested in ***Dynamical Systems***, ***Algebraic geometry***, and specifically in some of their applications in ***Machine Learning*** and ***Cryptography***.
- If you want, you can reach me at: nic.dalcin@gmail.com

- ðŸŒ± In the past I mainly focused on mathematical physics (quantum field theory and general relativity), but now I'm getting into Cryptography:
I like how lots of theoretical and different mathematical results can be applied there, even in a fun way!
